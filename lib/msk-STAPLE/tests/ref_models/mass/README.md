# Description
Model built in NMSBuilder just adding the ankle model bones and assigning
`DENSITY BONE = 1420 kg/m3 = 1420*10-9 	= 0.000001420 kg/mm3`
as in previous work by Dumas et al. (2005).

The purpose of NMSBuilder is simply to calculate the inertial parameters for 
verification purposes. This model is **NOT** usable for anything else.
